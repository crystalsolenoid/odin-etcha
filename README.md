# Etch-A-Div

Etch-A-Div is a pretend Etch-A-Sketch used to practice generating and manipulating DOM objects with JavaScript. It was made as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

Mobile support is not implemented. I could not make sense of touch-specific events. You can still tap, but dragging does not work.

I am most proud of the feature to identify and curve the four corner cells, to look more like the plastic original.
